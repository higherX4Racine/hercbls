The goal of hercbls is to automate and simplify some frequent tasks that
occur when processing data from the [U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics](https://www.bls.gov). That includes processing data that has
been downloaded after navigating the site [by
hand](https://www.bls.gov/data/), as well as data pulled from the
[API](https://www.bls.gov/developers/api_signature_v2.htm)

## Installation

You can install the development version of hercbls from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
